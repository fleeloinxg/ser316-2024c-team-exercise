There once was a Bratwurst salesman in Berlin, who took his horse in the Hauptstrasse. 
He rode his horse down the Hauptstrasse all the way to th Biergarten. 
Looking to his right, he saw two very wettbewerbsfaehig men drinking what looked like their 12th drink each.
The Bratwurst salesman thought to himself,
    "These men must be from Berlin, they are sehr wettbewerbsfaehig drinkers. But I am the better drinker".
